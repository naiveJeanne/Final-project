# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Scenario: Two players automatically play tic tac toe game, using MiniMax Theorem, starting with a random opening move of user and a random second move of another player. The user of this program is one of the user. He can choose how many time he wants to play this game in a roll, and the probability of being the first player in these games. The out come of each round (contains many tries in a roll) is the winning percentage of the user.   
(Used to think of researching MNK-game with random m, n and k, but it is too complex to implement...)
  
Purpose: To explore the relationship between being the first player in this game and being the winner.


### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
Since I use MiniMax Theorem to optimize every move instead of going a random move, I think there is a linear positive correlation betwwen the wining percentage of the user and the probability of being the first player. If there is 50% probability of the user to become the first player, the winning percentage may be 50% as well. If 100%, then 100% of winning percentage. If 0%, then 0% of winning percentage.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
The parameter of every round (N,K)  
N -- times of playing tic tac toe game in a roll -- int in 500, 1000, 2000 or more (discrete)
K -- the probability of the user to be the first player in the round -- float between 0 and 1 (continuous distribution)

I choose optimized move using MiniMax Theorem instead of a random one, I believe the former one is more like a human act.Â So my projects is a representation of reality to some extent.
